      <p class="intro">I am a third-year ITM student enrolled at Ted Rogers School of Management. I have vast amounts of experience leading multiple projects that involved converting raw data into useful information. I have always integrated well with my fellow peers on group projects and have always met deadlines. Furthermore, I have a passion to learn and that journey to learn never stops. </p>

        <h3>Network Security</h3>
        <p>I have explored the principles of data privacy, threats to privacy, international and national policy, particularly related to privacy-enhancing technologies as they apply to the management of information systems and e-Businesses. I was able to translate these skills to Server Administration providing firms a secure access to cloud services.</p>
